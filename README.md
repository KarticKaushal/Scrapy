1). 1st i edited "items.py" file & defined the fields i wanted to scrap and save in my csv file.

2). Then under "spiders" folder I created "males.py" crawler to. In which under 'parse()' trying to fetch the links for different players.

3). Created 'parse_indetail()' to fetch 'MalesItem()' class from 'items.py' & then scrape the different fields.
